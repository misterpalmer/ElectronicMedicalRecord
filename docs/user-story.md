### User Story
User stories are a technique used in software development to describe the features or functionality of a system from the perspective of an end user or customer. A user story typically consists of a short, simple statement that describes a particular goal or task that the user wants to accomplish with the system.

User stories are often written in a specific format, such as: "As a [type of user], I want [goal] so that [reason]." This format helps to capture the key elements of the user's needs and helps to ensure that the focus of the development effort remains on delivering value to the end user.

User stories are often used in agile software development methodologies, such as Scrum, as a way to define and prioritize the work that needs to be done. By focusing on the needs of the user, user stories help to ensure that the development team is building a system that meets the needs of the customer and delivers value.

#### User Stories for Sprint 1:
[ ]As a developer, I want to set up the development environment with Solidity, Remix, Ethereum, and Ganache, so that I can start developing the smart contract.
[ ]As a developer, I want to create the basic smart contract structure and data structures (e.g., structs for Patient, Doctor, and Medicine), so that I can implement the user registration functions for both patients and doctors.
[ ]As a patient, I want to be able to register my account on the platform, so that I can access my medical records.
[ ]As a doctor, I want to be able to register my account on the platform, so that I can access my patients' medical records.
[ ]As a developer, I want to implement the access control mechanisms (e.g., onlyDoctor and onlyPatient modifiers), so that only authorized users can access the system.
[ ]As a tester, I want to ensure that the user registration functionality and access control are working as expected, so that we can move on to the next sprint.

#### User Stories for Sprint 2:
[ ]As a doctor, I want to be able to add and update patient data (e.g., addDisease, updatePatientDetails), so that I can provide better care to my patients.
[ ]As a patient, I want to be able to view my medical records on the platform, so that I can keep track of my health.
[ ]As a developer, I want to implement error handling and appropriate access control for patient record management functions, so that the system remains secure and reliable.
[ ]As a tester, I want to ensure that the patient record management functionality is working as expected, so that we can move on to the next sprint.

#### User Stories for Sprint 3:
[ ]As a doctor, I want to be able to add and prescribe medicines (addMedicine and prescribeMedicine), so that I can provide better care to my patients.
[ ]As a patient, I want to be able to view details of the prescribed medicines on the platform, so that I can be informed about my treatment.
[ ]As a developer, I want to implement error handling and access control for medicine-related functions, so that the system remains secure and reliable.
[ ]As a tester, I want to ensure that the medicine management and prescription functionality is working as expected, so that we can move on to the next sprint.

#### User Stories for Sprint 4:
[ ]As a doctor, I want to be able to view my patients' data and prescribed medicines (viewPatientDataByDoctor and viewPrescribedMedicineToPatient), so that I can provide better care to my patients.
[ ]As a patient, I want to be able to view my doctor's details on the platform, so that I can be informed about my treatment.
[ ]As a developer, I want to implement error handling and access control for doctor-patient interaction functions, so that the system remains secure and reliable.
[ ]As a tester, I want to ensure that all functionalities are working as expected, so that we can deploy the final product to the Ethereum network and host the dApp on a suitable blockchain instance.
