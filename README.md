## Security

While I have strict standards for code quality and test coverage, it's important to note that this project may not be
entirely risk-free. Although I have taken measures to ensure the security of the contracts, they have not yet been
audited by a third-party security researcher.

### Caveat Emptor

Please be aware that this software is experimental and is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. I do not
offer any warranties, and I cannot be held responsible for any direct or indirect loss resulting from the continued use
of this codebase.
